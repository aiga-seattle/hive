I'm a design strategy consultant based in New York City, specializing in user research, experience strategy, product strategy, and innovation.

I come from a background in psychology, philosophy, and literary studiesâ€”all of which have a strong influence on my design and strategic processes. I strive for a deep understanding of the relationship between people and technology, as this relationship is what shapes product design.

I frequently teach, write, and speak on a variety of topics including intro UX, strategy, context-aware computing, philosophy and design, mobile UX, knowledge work, lean process and theory, and semiotics. My articles have been published in UX Magazine, Semionaut, UX Booth, and the Journal of Information Architecture (forthcoming). I also teach classes through General Assembly and independently for clients on topics such as Intro to UX, Research Methods, Design Thinking, and Product Ideation Methods.
